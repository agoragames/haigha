Reader and Writer conform to RabbitMQ and QPid errata as documented

0.2.3 
=====

First changelog.

Removed manipulation of channels in Connection.disconnect(). It's now
up to the application to manage channels when explicitly shutting down a
connection or when the socket is dropped and the strategy reconnects. This
fixed a problem wherein an application may have created a connection,
created some channels and queued operations on them, but it takes the
strategy a few attempts before completing a socket connection.

Fixed character escpaing when logging outbound ContentFrames.
