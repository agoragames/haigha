  def __init__(self, connection):

    Initialize a transport on a haigha.Connection instance.

  def process_channels(self, channels):
    '''
    Process a set of channels by calling Channel.process_frames() on each. 
    Some transports may choose to do this in unique ways, such as through 
    a pool of threads.

    The default implementation will simply iterate over them and call 
    process_frames() on each.
    '''
    for channel in channels:
      channel.process_frames()

  def read(self, timeout=None):
    '''
    Read from the transport. If no data is available, should return None. The
    return value can be any data type that is supported by the haigha.Reader
    class.

    Caller passes in an optional timeout. Each transport determines how to
    implement this.
    '''
    return None

  def buffer(self, data):
    '''
    Buffer unused bytes from the input stream.
    '''

  def write(self, data):
    '''
    Write some bytes to the transport.
    '''
    
  def disconnect(self):
    '''
    Disconnect from the transport. Typically socket.close(). This call is 
    welcome to raise exceptions, which the Connection will catch.

    The transport is encouraged to allow for any pending writes to complete
    before closing the socket.
