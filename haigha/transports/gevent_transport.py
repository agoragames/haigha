class GeventTransport(SocketTransport):
  '''
  Transport using gevent backend. It relies on gevent's implementation of 
  sendall to send whole frames at a time. On the input side, it uses a gevent
  semaphore to ensure exclusive access to the socket and input buffer.

  NOTE:
  This is new to haigha and there may be integration issues with some versions
  of RabbitMQ. In particular, what may happen when a blocking call to send a
  frame allows another thread to queue another frame, but the frames can't be 
  interlaced due to how the protocol is defined or implemented. A lot of the
  'synchronous' calls have very specific expectations. If this becomes a
  problem then the quickest way to solve it would be to switch to non-blocking
  so that the same thread of execution is allowed to send all of its frames in
  sequence. In that case, the gevent implementation may be pushed into the
  EventSocket as another supported concurrency lib.

  Note also that the blocking nature of the sockets means that the any threads
  running IO should actively yield with a sleep(0) to ensure other threads are
  serviced. In a saturated environment, failure to do so will lead to 
  significant lags in signal handling or other IO. In practice, a typical
  client is attaching to other data stores so those could be enough to yield.
