  '''
  Manages a pool of channels for transaction-based publishing.  This allows a
  client to use as many channels as are necessary to publish while not creating
  a backlog of transactions that slows throughput and consumes memory.

  The pool can accept an optional `size` argument in the ctor, which caps the
  number of channels which the pool will allocate. If no channels are available
  on `publish()`, the message will be locally queued and sent as soon as a 
  channel is available. It is recommended that you use the pool with a max
  size, as each channel consumes memory on the broker and it is possible to
  exercise memory limit protection seems on the broker due to number of
  channels.
